                <h1>Attack on Titan</h1>
                <h3>Synopsis:</h3>
                <p>
                    Centuries ago, mankind was slaughtered to near extinction by monstrous humanoid creatures called titans, forcing humans to hide 
                    in fear behind enormous concentric walls. What makes these giants truly terrifying is that their taste for human flesh is not 
                    born out of hunger but what appears to be out of pleasure. To ensure their survival, the remnants of humanity began living 
                    within defensive barriers, resulting in one hundred years without a single titan encounter. However, that fragile calm is soon 
                    shattered when a colossal titan manages to breach the supposedly impregnable outer wall, reigniting the fight for survival 
                    against the man-eating abominations. After witnessing a horrific personal loss at the hands of the invading creatures, 
                    Eren Yeager dedicates his life to their eradication by enlisting into the Survey Corps, an elite military unit that combats the 
                    merciless humanoids outside the protection of the walls. Based on Hajime Isayama's award-winning manga, Shingeki no Kyojin 
                    follows Eren, along with his adopted sister Mikasa Ackerman and his childhood friend Armin Arlert, as they join the brutal war 
                    against the titans and race to discover a way of defeating them before the last walls are breached.
